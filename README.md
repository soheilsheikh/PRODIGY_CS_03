> The GUI consists of an entry field for the password, a check button to initiate the strength check, a clear button to erase the entered password, and a text box to display the results.


### Password Strength Meter

> The program analyzes the password based on the following criteria:
 1. Lowercase letters
 2. Uppercase letters
 3. Digits
 4. Whitespaces
 5. Special characters

>A score is assigned based on the presence of these elements in the password. The program then provides feedback on the password's strength along with a progress bar visualization.

### Stronger Passwords, Better Security

> This program encourages users to create strong passwords by highlighting the importance of using a combination of different character types. By following the program's suggestions, users can improve their password security and make it more resistant to hacking attempts.
